# Dimension Multiple Lines

### Use Case:

A common task to annotate architectural floor plans is to place dimension strings that clarify the spacing and location of parallel walls (or other planar objects, lines, etc.).

Annotating dimensions is typically accomplished by panning around and individually selecting each necessary line, occuring dozens of times in a floor plan and even hundreds of times in a multi-floor project.

The `Dimension Multiple Lines` tool allows a user to swipe-select multiple parallel line objects at once and generates a dimension string attached to all in a single command to save time and minimize manual clicks.
