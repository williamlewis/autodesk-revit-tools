# Categorize Views & Sheets

### Use Case:

The owner and its vendor (local Architect of Record) both need to collaborate within the same Revit 3D model.

File content such as sheeted drawings and working views should remain sorted and separated by company.

This tool populates a shared parameter value which is used as a criteria for sorting within the Project Browser, based on project file template.
