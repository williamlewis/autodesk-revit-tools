# Open Multiple Views

### Use Case:

Common tasks in Revit are often performed in batches, such as revising drawings across multiple similar floor plans.

The default Revit functionality to open views / sheets individually by double-clicking each is tedious, distracting, and inefficient.

This tool allows a user to select all relevant views from the Project Browser at once, then opens them together quickly in a batch without waiting for the contents of each view to load.
