# Remove Duplicate Titleblocks

### Use Case:

A series of 500+ Revit 3D model files was found to contain identical titleblock instances in the same position on sheets.

In addition to duplicate titleblock objects, a critical legal disclaimer was not displayed consistenty on all sheets as needed.

The **Remove Duplicate Titleblocks** tool:
1. Filter selects the relevant sheets
2. Removes duplicate titleblock instances from those sheets
3. Overwrites the related settings to ensure visibility of the legal text note
4. Prints a table of remaining titleblocks as a visual confirmation of results to the user

### Business Impact:
The tool expedited a tedious quality control task **90%** by automating the removal of duplicate content and correction of display settings across approximately 2,500 individual floor plans.
